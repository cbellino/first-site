# First site

## What the frak is this crappy site anyway ?

This is the first site i ever finished, something like 15 years ago, and it is:

- Ugly!
- Full of bad practices.
- Ripped with typos, grammar issues and other weird issues.

I mainly uploaded it for backup purposes but hey, might as well host it for all to see the shame.
